pip install Django
	- ran command, 2 files were installed, Django-1.11.2 and pytz-2017.2
	- Not entirely sure what pytz, but a brief search states that it’s “World 	
		Timezone Definitions”  

pip list
	- ran command and got a red line warning “DEPRECATION: The default format 	
		will switch to columns in the future. You can use --format=(legacy|
		columns) (or define a format=(legacy|columns) in your pip.conf under 		the [list] section) to disable this warning.” 
	- found a stack overflow from 6 months ago addressing this message.  Not sure 		when this feature will actually change to no longer need this message, 		but also not 100% sure what the impact of this feature change would 			be.  
	- Got a list that included Django (1.11.2), pip (9.0.1), pytz (2017.2), setup 		tools (32.1.0), and wheel (0.29.0)
	- Not entirely sure what wheel is either, brief search says it’s a type of 	
		compressed archive

pip install Django
	- running this command again gave me what amounts to a confirmation that this 		was already installed with the message “Requirement already satisfied” 		followed by the location of the Django and pytz packages.

pip freeze 
	- this command showed me just the Django and pytz files (not the pip, setup 		tools, or wheel that I saw in the list command)
	- additionally, it displayed their versions with == rather than in ()

cd ~/Desktop . . . pip freeze > requirements.txt . . . ls
	- a “requirements.txt” file is now on my desktop

pip uninstall Django 
	- first it displayed a very long list of files connected to Django that would 		be uninstalled and asked for confirmation to proceed
	- after I confirmed I got message stating that Django was successfully 			uninstalled

pip show Django
	- was given another command line, no response

pip search Flask
	- was given a long list of packages(?) along with descriptions
	- chose to at random to google search:
		1) perfume (0.2) - Simple Object Oriented layer for Flask.
		2) Flask-Alchemy (0.1) - The fastest markdown parser in pure Python
	- found both in the “Python Package Index”
	- again, not 100% sure what these are, but wondering if they are similar to 		the libraries we used during web fun
